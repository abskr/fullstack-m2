        -->

        </div>

    <!-- EXERCISE 4

            - Tracklist
            - ... And whatever you think it's interesting about it!
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 5
            Worst album list! Find out the music you don't really like or you find overrated and list it
            in this "hall of shame" chart!
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 6
            Do you have any musician / band you admire or you are fan of?

            Feel free to experiment in this part of the page.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 7
            Just covers!
            Create a tapestry of album pictures. Every album picture must be "square" (use CSS to do that).
            Put at least 20 covers (also repeated) to have a nice effect and see how Bootstrap handles it.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 8
            Implement a footer with some information / social links
